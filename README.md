# My Dotfiles

This is a collection of my configuration files for my **Hyprland / Wayland** desktop environment.

## Contents

- **Hyprland**: configuration for the Wayland compositor  
- **Kitty**: terminal configuration  
- **Rofi**: launcher configuration  
- **Waybar**: the only thing I’ve slightly *pimped* — minimalist, transparent, floating  
- **Zsh**: shell configuration  

## About

This is mainly a backup to keep my configurations safe, if it can help someone else, even better.

We’re far from extreme ricing, but it works, and my Waybar still looks pretty cool :)
